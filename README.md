# Contribution
1. This repository stores Matlab code of our proposed blind source separation (BSS) algorithm that is fast and performs better than some state-of-the-art BSS algorithms. The proposed algorithm can separate any number of sources using two microphones.

2. This repository stores Matlab codes of all BSS algorithms we used as a comparison in our ICASSP 2022 paper "HARVESTING PARTIALLY-DISJOINT TIME-FREQUENCY INFORMATION FOR IMPROVING DEGENERATE UNMIXING ESTIMATION TECHNIQUE".

These BSS algorithms including
1. Degenerate unmixing estimation technique (DUET) (Rickard, 2007).
2. Independent vector analysis (IVA) (Kim et al., 2006).
3. Independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA) (Kitamura et al., 2016).
4. Multi-channel non-nagetive factorization (MULTI_NMF) (Ozerov et al., 2010).
4. Full-rank spatial model (FULLRANK) (Duong et al., 2010).
